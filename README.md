# Building Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Applications

See [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/instructor-led-workshops/natural-language-processing/) and [there](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/deep-learning/deep-learning-education/dli-building-transformer-based-natural-language-1370520-r3-web-3.pdf) for _official_ information.

## This repository ...

... shows the main material as well as the **solutions** to the _FIXME_ challanges and questions. While the according conda environments have been downloaded as _.txt_ files, the functionality of the notebooks remains limited.

## The course ...

... is fast paced but very well structured. The topics are:

- Machine Learning in NLP
- Self-Supervision, BERT, and Beyond
- Production Deployment

For each of these topics, free access to a deep learning cloud computing platform with topical Jupyter notebooks is provided so course participants can apply their new knowledge. These _Labs_ feature challenges that test the understanding. After these Labs, the knowledge is assessed via a multiple choice test (30%) and a final lab with further challenges (70%).

All materials – in particular also to the cloud computing platform with accelerated computing – are available until 6 months after the course.
